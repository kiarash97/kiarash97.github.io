### M.S Projects
  Will be added soon !

### B.Sc Projects

#### Thesis Project
* Machine Learning / Deep Learning/ Reinforcement Learning
* Computer Vision
* Natural Language Processing
* Data Mining / Bioinformatics

#### Research Projects
* Research on using Transfer Learning for hasten the converge time of Reinforcement Learning for ATARI games (June 2018 - October 2018)
  - My first project as I have join the Machine Learning Laboratory was on Transfer Learning supervised by Dr Nasser Mozayani. I worked in a group three B.Sc students and one M.S student. The whole idea was to build a model as a state representation for ATARI games. I continued the implementation of the M.S student which was Deep Q-Learning for Breakout and Pong games and enhanced the converge time with multi-agent. Then I build an Autoencoder and Variational Autoencoder model which they were feed with images of these two games as a skilled agent were playing the games. The results were fine for state representation for new ATARI games, but the group are still working on using Video Encoding for increasing the accuracy.
  
* Research on Twitter, for Hashtag Recommendation(March 2019 - Present)
  - I am working with a M.S student on her Master thesis topic which is Hashtag recommendation. After the studying related works phase, I scrapped twitter data using Twint module whith Python. Then we are going to implement a word embedding and build a graph for words and hashtags in tweets and then use graph mining methods to find clusters of tweets. We will use this clusters for Hashtag recommending.

* Analysing of Persian Word Association using Cognitive Science (January 2018 - June 2018)
  -  My second project in the Data Mining Laboratory was Persian Word Association supervised by Dr Hossein Rahmani. I worked with two B.Sc students and one M.S student on this project. We gathered a dataset with developing a survey website and analysing the results and eventually published the dataset.
  
* Fraud Detection (January 2016 - April 2016)
  -  My first project as I have join the Data Mining Laboratory was on Fraud Detection for German Bank Dataset supervised by Dr Hossein Rahmani. The goal was to fit the best model in order to classify people into two classes of trustworthy and untrurstworthy. The best model was SVM with more than 91% accuracy and I use decision tree for visualization the model.
